# Jackery Monitor — container image (cloud-only build).
#
# Same image runs either the web server or the cloud bridge — the compose
# file picks which entrypoint to use per service.
#
#   - server.py  : FastAPI dashboard + WebSocket fan-out (port 8000)
#   - bridge.py  : Cloud poller, JSON-RPC over TCP (port 8766)
#
# Compose profiles:
#   mac        - dashboard only; bridge runs on the macOS host
#   mock       - no hardware/cloud, synthetic telemetry (UI dev)
#   synology   - dashboard + bridge, both in containers (Linux/NAS)

# Backup transport binaries:
#   * smbclient (Samba) — userspace SMB client used by backup.py +
#     backup_discover.py. We deliberately do NOT install cifs-utils /
#     mount.cifs: it requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN + capset() seccomp
#     permission and tends to fail on Synology with "Unable to apply
#     new capability set." smbclient avoids the kernel mount entirely.
#   * rsync, openssh-client — for the rsync transport (over SSH or
#     rsyncd). The user generates an SSH key on the NAS / desktop and
#     pastes the private key into the form; the server saves it
#     encrypted at rest, materialises it as a 0600 tempfile during
#     each rsync invocation, and unlinks it afterwards.

# Note on non-root: deliberately running as root inside the container.
# Switching to a non-root UID would break existing deployments where the
# /data volume already has files owned as root from prior versions, since
# the new UID couldn't read its own credentials. The container itself
# is isolated, so root-in-container is acceptable for this app's threat
# model. Future migration: ship an entrypoint that chowns /data first
# and then drops via gosu, with a one-time backfill for existing volumes.
