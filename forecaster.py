Battery state-of-charge forecaster.

Three pieces, all simple:

1. **Solar model** — fits the linear coefficient k where:
       observed_solar_w ≈ k * ghi_w_m2
   using paired hourly samples from `energy_db` and Open-Meteo historical
   irradiance. Equivalent to "effective panel capacity"; subsumes panel
   area, efficiency, tilt, and partial shading.

2. **Load model** — averages output_w by (hour-of-day, weekday-vs-weekend)
   over recent samples. Captures fridge cycles, lighting, daily routines.

3. **SOC simulation** — walks forward hour by hour:
       SOC(t+1) = SOC(t) + (solar_w(t) - load_w(t)) * 1h / capacity_wh
   AC/grid charging is intentionally NOT modeled — the user is mostly
   solar, and predicted SOC dips are MORE alarming/actionable when grid
   charging is excluded. Add it later if needed.

Battery capacity defaults are hardcoded by Jackery model code; unknown
models fall back to 3024 Wh (HomePower 3000 size).

      - `ac_input_wh` is below the same floor (no Kasa-driven grid charge),

    The pure-percentage model (`fit_inverter_overhead_pct`) systematically
    misses the steady-state baseline draw — main-unit BMS, idle inverter,
    DC-bus losses. The advisor flagged a 430W unaccounted gap on the
    user's 5000+ on 2026-05-04 that boiled down to exactly this model
    limitation, AND a residual gap on 2026-05-23 that turned out to be
    PER-PACK BMS/balancing scaling with the expansion pack count.

    `pack_count` (default 0) is the number of expansion packs on this
    device. When > 0, we SUBTRACT `pack_count * PER_PACK_BASELINE_W`
    from each window's observed drain BEFORE attributing the residual
    to (parasitic_w, overhead_pct). That way the fit's parasitic_w
    captures the MAIN UNIT's residual only, and the per-pack
    contribution is attributed cleanly as a separate constant term
    that build_forecast adds back when feeding the simulator.

    Returns ``(parasitic_w, overhead_pct, n_windows)``. Falls back to
    ``(default_parasitic_w, default_overhead_pct, n)`` when the fit
    can't converge or produces implausible coefficients (negative
    parasitic, >1000W parasitic, negative overhead, >50% overhead).

    When the user's load distribution is narrow (max/min ratio below
    `MIN_LOAD_RANGE_FOR_JOINT_FIT`), the joint OLS regression is
    ill-conditioned — the (load, drain) pairs are nearly collinear and
    the solver collapses to the priors. In that case we pin
    `overhead_pct` at the default and fit `parasitic_w` alone via the
    median of `drain_i - load_i * (1 + default_pct)` per window. This
    is what the advisor flagged on 2026-05-05 after we shipped the
    initial joint fit.

    Window-selection gates mirror `fit_inverter_overhead_pct` exactly;
    keep them in sync with `diagnose_idle_windows` if you change either.

    tables for other models are user-configurable and accessory-
    dependent — there is no correct answer per model_code, only per
    deployment.

    Solar must be excluded. Two paths, in order of trust:
      1. The cloud reports `ac_input_w` (`acip`) classifying input as
         grid charging — when ≥ min_input_w we use it directly.
      2. When `acip` is 0 but input_w is high (the broken-cloud case
         the user has — see advisor anomaly), fall back to local-time
         night hours where solar is physically impossible. `input_w`
         during those hours must be AC charging via the smart-charge
         Kasa plug or similar.
    Daytime samples without a populated `acip` are skipped — solar vs
    grid can't be disentangled there.

    Solar exclusion (in priority order):
      a. `weather_hourly` GHI lookup at the sample's hour. If GHI < 50
         W/m² the sun is physically too low to produce, so any input
         must be from another source (AC plug). This is timezone-free
         and works for any user worldwide.
      b. Local-time night band [21:00, 06:00) using `tz_offset_seconds`
         as a fallback when no weather data is available.
      c. If neither check is conclusive (daytime, no weather), skip.

    against the SOC gain it produced on clean charging windows.

    Charge efficiency varies between users: different inverter model,
    different battery chemistry/age, different ambient temperature all
    move it. Hard-coding 0.90 is a guess that's wrong for everyone
    except whoever set it.

    Algorithm: walk adjacent hourly buckets and keep windows where:
      - SOC actually rose (≥1pp — sensor resolution),
      - SOC at start < 95% (avoid the top-balance regime where charge
        tapers and the BMS reports input that isn't really stored),
      - SOC at end ≤ 99% (no clipping at the 100% ceiling),
      - net_input_wh ≥ 100Wh in the window (see net-energy note below),
      - dt 1-6h (longer than that mixes regimes).

    For each qualifying window:
      net_input_wh = max(input_wh - output_wh, 0)
      stored_wh = ΔSOC% * capacity_wh / 100
      efficiency = stored_wh / net_input_wh

    Net-energy denominator: when loads run concurrently with charging
    (e.g. solar charges battery while the home draws ~150W constantly),
    only `input_wh - output_wh` is the energy actually available to
    store. The original code divided stored_wh by raw input_wh, which
    silently attributed the load passthrough as charging losses — on
    one user's history that pulled the fit to 0.583, well below the
    LiFePO4 + inverter physical floor of ~0.85. simulate_soc applies
    `eff` to (solar - load) net inflow, so this denominator matches
    the simulator's semantics. The fit is still slightly biased low
    by parasitic+overhead drain during the window (those drains eat
    into ΔSOC but aren't subtracted from input_wh), but the residual
    is single-digit-percent rather than the multi-tens that load
    passthrough caused.

    Take the median across windows for robustness. Clamp to a sane
    physical range [0.50, 0.99] — anything outside that band is almost
    certainly bad data (sensor glitch or mis-attributed energy flow).
    Falls back to `default` when too few windows are available.
