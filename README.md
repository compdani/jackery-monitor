Self-hosted dashboard for Jackery power stations. Live per-battery state +
power flow, 6-hour history chart, output control over MQTT, energy
aggregation in SQLite, **5-day solar SOC forecast**, **smart-charge
automation that turns on a grid-power Kasa plug only when the forecast
says you won't make it through the night**, and **an optional Claude AI
advisor that reviews yesterday's predictions vs reality every morning
and suggests one-click tweaks** to the algorithm constants.

Designed to run on a Synology NAS in Docker. Works anywhere with Docker
Compose. Multi-device — handles multiple Jackery devices on the same account
(e.g. Explorer 5000 Plus with up to 5 expansion packs + HomePower 3000) and
per-device automation rules and AI insights. **The Live tab shows every
unit at a glance** (SOC, solar/load, charge state); click a card to focus
the full power-flow hero. **Each browser also picks which Jackery it's
viewing independently** (per-browser cookie), so the phone and the laptop
can look at different units at the same time without stomping each other.

It connects through the **Jackery cloud account** (the same one the official app uses). On first launch the dashboard prompts you to sign in; credentials are encrypted on disk (AES-256-GCM on Linux/Synology, macOS Keychain on Mac) and never leave your host.

![Dashboard — Live tab with state of charge, today's energy with savings breakdown, animated Tesla-style power flow diagram, output toggles, collapsible battery packs, and 6-hour history chart](docs/screenshots/dashboard-live.png)

*Live tab: state of charge with sunset SOC prediction, today's kWh + solar/grid dollar breakdown, animated power flow diagram (Solar → Battery → Loads with traveling-dot animation, speed proportional to wattage), output toggles + AC-charge plug control, collapsible per-pack SOC card, and the 6-hour battery + power chart.*

> **🤖 New: AI advisor.** Each morning Claude Opus (with extended thinking) reviews the last 48h of forecast errors, smart-charge decisions, samples, and weather, then proposes specific config tweaks — *"raise `max_charge_w` from 1500 → 1850, your unit consistently pulls more during fast-charge mode"* — that you approve with one click. Nothing applies automatically. See [AI features](#ai-features-optional) below.

---

## What's in it

- **Live tab** — when two or more Jackerys are on the account, a **fleet
  strip** of compact cards sits above the hero (name, system SOC, solar /
  load W, charge state, pack count). Click a card to focus that unit.
  Then: hero battery card with mood-aware glow (green when charging,
  blue when discharging, red when low), today's KPIs with solar / grid /
  net savings breakdown, **Tesla-style animated power flow diagram**
  (Solar / Grid → Battery → Loads with travelling dots whose speed
  encodes wattage), 6-hour chart with smooth-bezier fills + dual-axis
  battery %, hover tooltip. Single-device accounts skip the strip.
- **Output + grid control** — one toggle row covers all five power
  paths: AC, DC, USB, Car output ports plus the AC-charge Kasa plug
  (the latter only renders when configured for the active device).
  Outputs go over Jackery cloud MQTT (`emqx.jackeryapp.com`), AC-charge
  goes via direct LAN call to the Kasa plug. Backend retries transient
  failures up to 3× before surfacing an error; UI re-syncs to actual
  plug state on failure (no more stuck "err" labels).
- **Energy tab** — today / 7d / 30d / lifetime kWh totals, time-bucketed
  history chart with 6h / 24h / 7d / 30d ranges, per-device totals.
- **Device tab** — model, serial, cloud connection state, last update time.
  "Pause polling" with duration picker so you can hand the cloud session to
  the phone app without the bridge stealing it back.
- **Forecast tab** — 5-day hourly SOC simulation. Solar regression fitted
  from your own observed solar-vs-GHI pairs (Open-Meteo); load model uses
  per-hour-of-day medians with a runaway-bucket cap so a single high-output
  event doesn't dominate. Predicted-vs-actual chart accumulates over time.
- **Battery packs card** (5000 Plus / 2000 Plus + expansions) — per-pack SOC,
  input W, temp. Real-time updates over MQTT (no polling).
  Auto-detected total capacity = main + N × expansion (per-model pack
  Wh from `models.json`). Collapsed by default with the summary line always
  visible (`5 packs · avg 76% · system 76% · 237W in`); click the header
  to drill in. Hidden cleanly on no-pack devices.
- **Smart charge** (per-device, in Automation tab) — every 5
  minutes, runs a counterfactual forecast (what would SOC do without
  any AC charging?). If the predicted sunrise SOC falls below your
  target, picks the cheapest TOU hours up to sunrise–1h margin, with
  the deadline anchor mandatory so charging always finishes in time.
  Locks ON past sunrise if the target hasn't been hit. Re-enters on
  drift below target. All decisions persisted with predicted-vs-
  actual analytics. **Backtest button** replays the last N days of
  decisions through the current code so behavior changes can be
  validated without waiting for fresh data; supports a `target_override`
  to stress-test the discontinuous-schedule path.
- **AI advisor** (optional, daily Claude Opus) — diagnoses the residual
  errors in your forecast and smart-charge tracking, proposes config
  tweaks bounded to a safe whitelist, surfaces anomalies. Human approves
  each suggestion via one-click Apply / Dismiss. Audit log of every
  applied change. See [AI features](#ai-features-optional).
- **Decision narration** (optional, Haiku per fired decision) —
  1-2 sentence plain-English explanation of each smart-charge decision,
  attached to the persisted history row.
- **Automation tab** — Kasa smart-plug rules driven by battery SOC.
  Each rule targets a specific Jackery device, fires once per
  threshold crossing, retries automatically on transient failures.
  Plugs are assigned to a specific Jackery so the smart-charge
  picker only shows the relevant ones. **Self-healing reachability**:
  a background reconciler probes every saved Kasa plug every 5 min
  with per-device exponential backoff (5/10/20/30 min, capped) on
  failure, persists `last_seen` / `last_error` / `consecutive_failures`,
  and lights up a red dot on the Automation tab when any plug is
  offline so you know to look.
- **Logs tab** — ring buffer of bridge events (login, MQTT pushes, contested
  sessions, automation fires, errors). Filter by level or category.
- **Settings tab** — runtime-tunable poll cadences, low-battery threshold,
  session-contested cooldown.
- **PWA** — install on your phone home screen via Safari → Share → Add to
  Home Screen. Service worker caches the UI shell.
- **Auth** — single-user username/password login on first boot. Optional;
  pair with Cloudflare Access for internet-exposed deployments.
- **Real-time updates** — MQTT subscribe to the device push topic gives you
  ~500ms-fresh telemetry instead of HTTP polling rate.
- **Auto-deploy** — `git push` triggers a Watchtower-driven container update
  on the NAS within a minute or two. No manual restarts.

Both server and bridge run as the same image (`ghcr.io/yaniverel-code/jackery-monitor`),
just different `command:`s in compose. The shared `/data` volume holds energy
history, credentials (encrypted), automation rules, and settings.

---

## Quick start — Synology / Linux

The default `docker-compose.yml` pulls a pre-built image from GitHub
Container Registry — no local build step on the NAS.

1. Install **Container Manager** (Synology Package Center) or Docker Compose v2.
2. Get the project files onto the NAS via File Station: download the
   [latest zip](https://github.com/YanivErel-code/jackery-monitor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
   and extract into `/docker/jackery-monitor/`.
3. **Container Manager → Project → Create**:
   - Project name: `jackery-monitor`
   - Path: `/docker/jackery-monitor`
   - Source: "Use existing docker-compose.yml"
4. Click **Next → Done**. Container Manager pulls the image (~30s) and
   starts the services.
5. Open `http://<nas-ip>:8123`.
6. **First visit:** pick a username + password to lock down the dashboard.
7. **Second:** sign into your Jackery cloud account through the dashboard
   modal. Credentials are encrypted at rest.

The default port is `8123`. Set `JACKERY_HTTP_PORT=8000` in `.env` if you
want it elsewhere.

### Updating

The compose file ships with a Watchtower service (`nickfedor/watchtower`,
a maintained drop-in for the unmaintained `containrrr/watchtower` image)
that polls GHCR every 60s and recreates the labelled containers when a
new `:latest` is published. Upstream Watchtower hardcodes Docker API
1.25 and crash-loops on engines that require 1.40+ (Synology Container
Manager, Docker 25+). So `git push` → image rebuild → ~60-90s → NAS is
up to date.

To update the **compose file itself** (env, services, ports), copy the
new `docker-compose.yml` to your NAS via File Station and recreate the
project. Watchtower cannot apply compose changes on its own.

## Quick start — macOS dev

Bridge runs on the Mac (uses macOS Keychain for credentials), dashboard
in Docker:

```bash
./run-bridge.sh      # listens on 127.0.0.1:8766
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile mac up
open http://localhost:8000
```

Or in fully-mock mode (no Jackery cloud, synthetic telemetry):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile mock up
```

---

## PWA install on phone

Open the dashboard URL in **Safari** (iOS) or **Chrome** (Android) →
**Share / menu → Add to Home Screen**. The app opens full-screen, no
browser chrome, looks like a native app. Service worker caches the UI
shell so it loads instantly even on slow networks.

For internet-accessible install, point Safari at your Cloudflare Tunnel
URL (see Authentication below) and Add to Home Screen there.

---

## Authentication

Two layers, use either or both:

### Cloudflare Access (recommended for public exposure)

Free for up to 50 users, edge-level, battle-tested OIDC stack.
1. Run a Cloudflare Tunnel on your NAS (synology has a one-click app).
2. Add a public hostname pointing at `localhost:8123`.
3. Cloudflare Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add a Self-hosted app
   pointing at the same hostname.
4. Add an Allow policy listing your authorized email(s).

Visit the public URL → email-OTP login → you're in.

### In-app username/password (built-in)

First visit auto-redirects to `/setup` where you pick a username and
password. From then on, `/login` is required. Sign-out button in the
top bar. Password is hashed with PBKDF2-SHA256, session is an
HMAC-signed cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, 30-day TTL).

The two layers compose: Cloudflare Access at the edge plus app login
gives you defense in depth.

---

## Automation

Drive Kasa smart plugs from your battery state of charge.

1. **Automation tab → Kasa account.** Enter your Kasa cloud email +
   password. Required for newer Kasa SMART devices (KP125M, EP25, KP405)
   that use KLAP authentication. Older devices (KP115, HS103) ignore
   credentials gracefully — saving them is safe.
2. **Devices section → + Add device.** Enter the Kasa plug's IP (find
   it in your router's DHCP table or the official Kasa app). Click
   **Test** to verify reachability and auto-fill the alias. Save.
   Repeat for every plug you want to control.
3. **Battery-driven rules → + New rule.** Pick a Jackery device,
   threshold (`<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=`, `>` and a percentage), action
   (`on` or `off`), and one of your saved Kasa devices. Save.

Rules are **edge-triggered**: a `<20%` rule fires once when SOC drops
through 20%, not every poll while it's below 20%. It won't fire again
until SOC goes back above 20% and drops below it again. Failed actions
retry on the next poll cycle (transient errors don't burn the trigger).

The bridge polls **all** Jackery devices on the account every cycle, so
a rule targeting your HomePower 3000 fires even while the dashboard is
viewing the 5000 Plus.

---

## AI features (optional)

Two Claude-powered features. Both are opt-in, gated by an Anthropic API key
saved encrypted in the data volume. Without a key, the rest of the app is
unaffected.

**1. Algorithm advisor (Opus + extended thinking, daily)**

The hard one. Every morning at 8 AM local time, per device, Claude Opus
reviews:
- Forecast accuracy by lead time bucket (last 14d MAE in pp)
- Last 24h hourly samples (SOC, in/out W, solar, AC input)
- Last 24h hourly weather (GHI, cloud cover)
- Last 48h predicted-vs-actual SOC pairs
- Last 7d smart-charge decisions joined to the actual sunrise SOC
- Current per-device smart-charge config

…and proposes specific config tweaks bound to a whitelist of safe
parameters (`max_charge_w`, `target_sunrise_soc_pct`,
`max_on_duration_minutes`). Each suggestion has an old → new value diff,
Claude's reasoning, and a confidence label. **Nothing applies
automatically** — the user clicks Apply or Dismiss. Hard safety floors
are enforced at apply time (e.g. target SOC can never go below 15%).

Anomaly callouts (e.g. *"the unit drew 3 kW between 2-4 AM yesterday —
unusual vs the prior week"*) appear without an Apply button.

Cost: ~$0.20-0.30 per review with Opus. Daily cadence + manual "Run
review now" button.

**Model + thinking effort selectable in the Settings tab** under
the Anthropic API key card:
- **Advisor model** dropdown — populated live from Anthropic's
  `/v1/models` endpoint (cached 5 min) when a key is saved, or a
  static fallback list otherwise. 1M-capable models get a separate
  "(1M context)" entry that toggles the `context-1m` beta header
  on for that call. Pattern matching for "1M-capable" is config-
  driven via `JACKERY_1M_MODEL_PATTERNS` (default `opus`) so
  future models pick up the variant without code changes.
- **Thinking effort** dropdown (low / medium / high) — adaptive
  thinking budget for Opus 4.7+. Higher = the model self-allocates
  more tokens to think before answering.
- **Narrator model** dropdown — pick a fast/cheap model for the
  per-decision rationale (typically the Haiku line).

Both models read at call time so a Settings change applies on the
next tick without a container restart. `JACKERY_ADVISOR_MODEL` env
var still works as an ops-control override.

**2. Decision narration (Haiku, per fired smart-charge decision)**

Each smart-charge decision gets a 1-2 sentence explanation:
*"Your battery will naturally charge to 83% by sunrise from solar alone,
so we're turning the charger off to avoid wasting grid electricity."*
The narration is attached to the persisted history row and shown
inline in the Recent decisions list.

Cost: ~1 Haiku call per fired decision (typically 1-3/day for an
active-mode setup). Pennies per month.

**Enabling:**
1. Get an API key at console.anthropic.com (need to add credit, $5 minimum).
2. **Settings tab → Anthropic API key.** Paste, click Save & test —
   the server validates with a 1-token API call before persisting.
   Stored encrypted at `/data/anthropic-creds.json`. Forget button
   wipes it.
3. **Automation tab → Smart charge → Claude narration toggle** unlocks
   once a key is saved. Toggle it on per-device.
4. **Automation tab → AI insights** is always visible; click Run review
   now to trigger an on-demand review (30-60s for Opus to think + reply).
5. The daily 8 AM tick fires automatically once a key is configured.

**Privacy of the AI features:** the API key never leaves your NAS. Each
review or narration call sends a snapshot of your telemetry +
configuration to Anthropic; no other data is shared. Disable both at
any time by clearing the key on the Settings page.

---

## Configuration

Most knobs live in the **Settings tab**, persisted to
`/data/settings.json`, applied on the next poll cycle (no restart):

| Setting | Default | Range | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server poll interval | 2 s | 1-300 | Server → bridge → browser cadence. With MQTT push the bridge has ~500ms-fresh data; this is just the WS broadcast rate. |
| Cloud poll interval | 15 s | 5-600 | HTTP poll to the Jackery cloud. Now a backstop since MQTT push handles real-time. |
| Session-contested cooldown | 60 s | 10-600 | After the phone app bumps the bridge off, how long before the bridge tries to reclaim. |
| Low-battery alert threshold | 20 % | 1-99 | Below this, the dashboard shows a low-battery alert banner. |

Env vars (`POLL_INTERVAL_S`, etc.) act as defaults until you save a
value through the UI.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Dashboard says *bridge unreachable* | `docker compose logs jackery-bridge` — usually a creds issue. Sign in via the dashboard. |
| Phone app keeps signing out when bridge is running | Expected — Jackery allows one session per account. Use the "Pause polling" button on the Device tab to hand the session over for a configurable duration, or wait the 60s contested-cooldown. |
| Output toggle button reverts after click | Normal — the device takes 5-30s to apply. The UI holds the optimistic state during a 30s "pending" window. |
| AC turns itself back on after you switch it off | Older builds treated any AC=OFF as an inverter trip and published AC-on after ~10s (or ~60s after a UI off). Current builds leave a port that reports OFF alone. Hardware-trip recovery (port still claims ON, watts collapsed) is opt-in via Settings → inverter trip-recovery floor; leave it at 0 unless your rig always has load. |
| Kasa device test fails with `Device response did not match our challenge` | Newer Kasa firmware uses KLAP auth. Enter your Kasa cloud email + password in **Automation tab → Kasa account**. Email is case-sensitive. |
| Kasa test fails with `ZoneInfoNotFoundError` | The image needs the `tzdata` Python package. Should be in latest builds — make sure Watchtower has pulled. |
| Live chart shows only 6 minutes after a deploy | Watchtower restarted the container, in-memory chart history was wiped. The chart hydrates from the energy DB on the next poll — give it a minute. |
| Energy DB lost data after a project recreate | Container Manager's "Delete project" can wipe the volume if you don't uncheck "Delete volumes". Always uncheck. |

## Privacy

What stays on your NAS:

- All Jackery telemetry history (`/data/energy.db`, SQLite)
- All automation rules and saved Kasa devices (`/data/automation.json`,
  `/data/kasa_devices.json`)
- All saved settings (`/data/settings.json`)
- All credentials, encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM:
  - Jackery cloud account → `/data/jackery-creds.json`
  - Kasa cloud account → `/data/kasa-creds.json`
  - Dashboard login → `/data/auth.json`
  - Anthropic API key (AI features) → `/data/anthropic-creds.json`
- The single AES key for all of the above → `/data/.jackery-creds.key`
  (mode 0600)
- All AI suggestions + audit log of applied changes (`/data/energy.db`)

What leaves the NAS:

- Calls to **`iot.jackeryapp.com`** (Jackery cloud) for telemetry + login.
- Calls to **`emqx.jackeryapp.com`** (Jackery cloud MQTT broker) for
  output control + real-time push.
- Calls to **Kasa smart plugs on your LAN** (direct IP) for automation
  actions; for newer Kasa SMART devices, this includes their cloud-account
  credentials in the local KLAP handshake.
- Calls to **`api.anthropic.com`** *only when you've saved an API key*:
  - Daily algorithm review: a snapshot of your forecast accuracy +
    last 24h of telemetry + smart-charge config (no PII, no credentials).
  - Per smart-charge decision narration (when narration toggle is on):
    just the action + reasoning + a few SOC numbers.
  - Disable at any time by clearing the API key on the Settings page.
- Calls to **Open-Meteo** (free, keyless weather API) for
  GHI + cloud-cover forecasts. Just your latitude/longitude in the
  query — no account, no key, no other data.

What is **never** sent off-device by this app:

- No analytics, telemetry, or usage data to the project author.
- No error reporting to a third party.
- No phone-home of any kind. The container speaks to Jackery's cloud
  (because it has to to read your battery state) and to Kasa devices
  on your LAN (because that's the point of the automation feature).
  That's it.

## Adding a new Jackery model

The model_code → battery capacity catalog lives in [`models.json`](models.json) at the repo root. If your device's model_code isn't listed, the forecaster falls back to a conservative 3024 Wh default. Catalogued today: Explorer 2000 Plus (2), Explorer 1000 v2 (8), Explorer 5000 Plus (13 / 22), Explorer 1500 Ultra (17), HomePower 3000 (19), Explorer 1500 v2 (21).

To check your device's model_code:
1. **Device tab → Show raw cloud properties** — look for `_dev_modelCode` in the dump.
2. Or check `Logs tab → /api/devices` debug query — shows `model_code` per device.

To add a new model:
1. Find your model_code via the steps above.
2. Look up the official capacity for your unit (Jackery's spec sheet).
3. PR an entry to `models.json`:
   ```json
   "42": {
     "capacity_wh": 2042,
     "pack_capacity_wh": 2042,
     "name": "Explorer 2000 Pro",
     "comment": "Confirmed on firmware vX.Y"
   }
   ```
   `pack_capacity_wh` is optional; omit it when expansion packs match the main unit.
4. Until your PR lands, you can also use **Device tab → Capacity override** for a per-device-only override that takes priority over the catalog.

## Limitations

- **Per-input solar (HPV vs LPV) isn't in the Jackery cloud API.** Only the
  total solar input (`ip - acip - cip`) is exposed. Confirmed empirically
  on a real device and across multiple independent reverse-engineering
  projects. The Jackery iOS app itself shows just one solar number.
- **One Jackery cloud session per account** — bridge + phone fight over
  it. We auto-cooldown on contests; the manual pause button gives you a
  longer window.
- **Kasa SMART devices need cloud credentials** for local control;
  older Kasa devices don't.
- **The cloud API is reverse-engineered** and could change at any time.
  We've added tolerance for known field-name variations, but a major API
  rev would need code changes.
- **`/v1/device/version` is not a capacity source.** Probes against that
  endpoint typically return `data: null` or error 10600. Model recognition
  comes from `modelCode` on `/v1/device/bind/list` plus [`models.json`](models.json).
