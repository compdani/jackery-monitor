"""
Thin wrapper around python-kasa for Solar Pow Monitor automations.

Two operations matter for our use case:
  - discover()         : find Kasa devices on the LAN (best-effort; depends on
                         Docker networking; bridge mode often blocks UDP
                         broadcasts).
  - set_state(host, on): toggle a specific device by IP. Always works as long
                         as the container can reach the device's IP directly.
  - status(host)       : read the current on/off state.

We keep the API minimal so the rest of the codebase doesn't need to know
about python-kasa internals (model classes, async iterator quirks, etc.).

Newer "KASA SMART" devices (KP125M, EP25, KP405, etc.) require the user's
Kasa cloud account credentials even for local control. We load them lazily
from kasa_creds (encrypted JSON in /data) and pass to python-kasa as a
Credentials object. Older devices (KP115, HS103) ignore the credentials
gracefully, so it's safe to always pass them when available.
